# Intro-to-Math-Modeling
This is MATLAB code I wrote for a mathematical modeling class at NYU.

The following is a description of the files in this repository:

1. HW4.m
- This file simulates the cooling and subsequent freezing of fruit (specifically, an orange) even though the ambient temperature is not 0 degrees celsius. The code produces a   graph representing the change in temperature of the fruit over time. The initial conditions can be changed to simulate different scenarios.


2. hw7code.m
- This file simulates the movement of a charged particle under the influence of a nonlinear drag force and spatially uniform electric charge placed in a unidirectional potential. The code simulates the particle's movement using two different methods: (Forward) Euler's method and the perturbation method.


3. IMM_final_proj_CODE_A.m
- This file simulates the oscillating movement of a pendulum at different starting angles.

4. IMM_final_proj_CODE_B1.m
- This file simulates the oscillating movement of a pendulum when there is air resistance present. The file simulates the event at various starting angles.


5. IMM_final_proj_CODE_C.m
- This file simulates the movement of a rod pendulum. A rod pendulum is essentially a rod where one end is held in a fixed position.

6. IMM_final_proj_CODE_D.m
- This file simulates the movement of a rod pendulum when there is air resistance present.

7. IMM_final_proj_CODE_timescale.m
- This file simulates the movement of a pendulum starting at 30 degrees. The objective was to determine a good timestep to run the simulation, which used the forward Euler method.
