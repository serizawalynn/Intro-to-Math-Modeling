# Intro-to-Math-Modeling
This is MATLAB code I wrote for a mathematical modeling class at NYU.

The following is a description of the files in this repository:

HW4.m
This file simulates the cooling and subsequent freezing of fruit (specifically, an orange) even though the ambient temperature is not 0 degrees celsius. The code produces a graph representing the change in temperature of the fruit over time. The initial conditions can be changed to simulate different scenarios.

hw7code.m
This file simulates the movement of a charged particle under the influence of a nonlinear drag force and spatially uniform electric charge placed in a unidirectional potential. The code simulates the particle's movement using two different methods: (Forward) Euler's method and the perturbation method.
